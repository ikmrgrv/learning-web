# HTML

## Concepts

* ### HyperLinks in HTML

  * HyperLinks allow us to weave our webpages(HTML pages served on world wide web) together.

* ### Anchor Element

  * Anchors in HTML are implemented using `<a>` tag
  * Attributes
    * `href` : pronounced 'ref', are the refernce of the anchor. Which means, they tell browsers where that anchor is pointing to
    * `target` : How browser should open the reference. Common values are `_blank` for new tab, `_download` for downloading resources
    * PseudoClasses : See CSS of `:hover, :visited, :active`.
    * Bonus CSS : See `textDecoration` property in CSS
