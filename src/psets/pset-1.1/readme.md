# HTML

## Concepts

* ### Forms in HTML

  * Forms are very crucial part of any HTML document which aims to be a web-app.
  * They enables the interactivity between browsers and the servers.
  * Homepage of [Google](http://www.google.com) is fundamentally a HTML-form with some anchors to different Google services.

* ### Form Element

  * Forms in HTML are implemented using `<form>` tag
  * Attributes
    * `action` : website/weblink/path where the document should submit the form data
    * `method` : HTTP Verb used to submit form data. Example: `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`.
    * `target` : Option to specify where should the result be shown, `_blank` for new tab.
